# Image_classification_1
Welcome to the Mobile Device Scratch Detection project! This repository contains the necessary scripts and documentation to train and infer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to detect scratches on the surface of mobile devices.


## 📁 Project Structure

Prerequistis -  Required Python environment, and Jupyter Notebook and in the scripts all the library information are given which need to pip in your virtual env
